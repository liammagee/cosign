Circles of Sustainability (CoS) is a practical user-friendly tool that project administrators can utilise to implement and track their sustainable projects with measurable outcomes. It also serves to develop a reporting template. CoS main objectives are to develop methodology for communities and develop ways of measuring sustainability that reflect the values that relate to the particular city or community. In this respect sustainability is defined in relation to a project.
